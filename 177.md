# Malicious users can make failed messages unreplayable by exhausting `maxReplayTimes`, leading to funds stuck forever on the origin chain

### Summary

The limitation of only allowing messages to be replayed up to `maxReplayTimes`, together with a conservative computation of the required gas limit to execute a message allows malicious users to prevent messages from being replayed. A malicious user can trigger `replayMessage` up to `maxReplayTimes` with a low gas limit, forcing the transaction to fail on the destination (Morph) chain, and making sender funds remain stuck forever in the L1.

### Root Cause

This bug requires some context prior to directly diving into the Root cause.

#### Introduction

Morph's `L1CrossDomainMessenger` acts as Morph’s entry point to transfer cross-layer messages. In order to send a message from L1->L2, the `sendMessage()` function is used, and the transaction executed will be internally tracked by encoding the following parameters into a unique identifier (the `xDomainCalldataHash`):

- `relayMessage()` method signature
- Sender of the transaction
- Receiver on the destination chain
- Value
- Nonce from the Message Queue
- The actual message

The encoding is done with the `_encodeXDomainCalldata()` internal function, which gives an encoded array of bytes that will later be hashed. This allows to track each specific message with a unique identifier:

```solidity
// File: L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol

function _sendMessage(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _message,
        uint256 _gasLimit,
        address _refundAddress 
    ) internal nonReentrant {
        ...
        bytes memory _xDomainCalldata = _encodeXDomainCalldata(_msgSender(), _to, _value, _messageNonce, _message);

        ...

        // record the message hash for future use.
        bytes32 _xDomainCalldataHash = keccak256(_xDomainCalldata);

        // normally this won't happen, since each message has different nonce, but just in case.
        require(messageSendTimestamp[_xDomainCalldataHash] == 0, "Duplicated message");
        messageSendTimestamp[_xDomainCalldataHash] = block.timestamp;
        ...

    }

```

It is worth noting that `_gasLimit` is **NOT** encoded neither used to obtain the final `_xDomainCalldataHash`. This is done because sometimes the gas limit specified to send a cross-layer transaction might not be enough to correctly execute the transaction on the L2. If this occurs, Morph allows users to retrigger the transaction via the `replayMessage()` function.

#### Replaying messages

As mentioned in the introduction, cross-layer messages that failed on the destination chain can be replayed via the `replayMessage()` function:

```solidity
// File: L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol

function replayMessage( 
        address _from,
        address _to, 
        uint256 _value, 
        uint256 _messageNonce,  
        bytes memory _message,
        uint32 _newGasLimit,
        address _refundAddress
    ) external payable override whenNotPaused notInExecution { 
        ...
        
        bytes memory _xDomainCalldata = _encodeXDomainCalldata(_from, _to, _value, _messageNonce, _message);
        bytes32 _xDomainCalldataHash = keccak256(_xDomainCalldata);

        ...

        ReplayState memory _replayState = replayStates[_xDomainCalldataHash];
        // update the replayed message chain.
        unchecked {
            if (_replayState.lastIndex == 0) {
                // the message has not been replayed before.
                prevReplayIndex[_nextQueueIndex] = _messageNonce + 1;
            } else {
                prevReplayIndex[_nextQueueIndex] = _replayState.lastIndex + 1;
            }
        }
        _replayState.lastIndex = uint128(_nextQueueIndex);

        // update replay times
        require(_replayState.times < maxReplayTimes, "Exceed maximum replay times");
        unchecked {
            _replayState.times += 1;
        }
        replayStates[_xDomainCalldataHash] = _replayState;

        ...

    }

```

This functionality allows users that have had their cross-layer transactions failed on the L2 (maybe due to setting an incorrect gas limit) to be replayed with a greater gas limit.

There are two points worth mentioning from this function:

- `replayMessage()` allows to pass a `_newGasLimit` parameter. As mentioned before, the gas limit is not used to obtain the unique identifier `_xDomainCalldataHash`, so this allows users that have had their message fail on the L2 due to setting a low gas limit on `sendMessage()` to retrigger it with a different gas limit. It is also worth noting that the gas limit **is not required to be greater than the gas limit set in the original call**.
- There is a maximum number of times that a message can be replayed. This is done because Morph also allows messages to be dropped when the cross-layer transaction leads to a circuit overflow (this is described in the [Handling Cross-layer (Bridge) Failures section](https://docs.morphl2.io/docs/how-morph-works/general-protocol-design/communicate-between-morph-and-ethereum#handling-cross-layer-bridge-failures). `maxReplayTimes` limits the amount of times a message can be replayed, because the logic to drop a message iterates a list that contains all the replayed messages and drops all of them. If there was not a limit on the amount of replayed messages, then the message dropping logic could be DoS'ed by a malicious user by inflating the amount of replayed messages:
    
    ```solidity
    // File: L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol
    
        function dropMessage( 
            address _from,
            address _to,
            uint256 _value,
            uint256 _messageNonce,
            bytes memory _message
        ) external override whenNotPaused notInExecution {
            // The criteria for dropping a message: 
            // 1. The message is a L1 message.
            // 2. The message has not been dropped before.
            // 3. the message and all of its replacement are finalized in L1.
            // 4. the message and all of its replacement are skipped.
            //
            // Possible denial of service attack:
            // + replayMessage is called every time someone want to drop the message.
            // + replayMessage is called so many times for a skipped message, thus results a long list.
            //
            // We limit the number of `replayMessage` calls of each message, which may solve the above problem.
    
            
    
            ...
    
          
     
            // check message is skipped and drop it.
            // @note If the list is very long, the message may never be dropped.
            while (true) {
                IL1MessageQueue(_messageQueue).dropCrossDomainMessage(_lastIndex);
                _lastIndex = prevReplayIndex[_lastIndex]; 
                if (_lastIndex == 0) break;
                unchecked {
                    _lastIndex = _lastIndex - 1;
                }
            }
     
            isL1MessageDropped[_xDomainCalldataHash] = true;
    
            // set execution context
            xDomainMessageSender = Constants.DROP_XDOMAIN_MESSAGE_SENDER;
            IMessageDropCallback(_from).onDropMessage{value: _value}(_message);
            // clear execution context
            xDomainMessageSender = Constants.DEFAULT_XDOMAIN_MESSAGE_SENDER;
        }
    
    ```
    

#### Gas limit estimations

Every time a message is sent via the CrossDomainMessenger contract, a gas estimation is performed in order to verify wether the gas limit specified by the user is actually enough to properly execute the transaction on the destination chain. This is done inside the message queue's `appendCrossDomainMessage()` function, using the `_validateGasLimit()` internal function. The gas limit validation will be carried out via the following process:

1. Every time a message is sent, the queue's `appendCrossDomainMessage()` method is called to actually send the message:

```solidity
// File: L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol

function _sendMessage(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _message,
        uint256 _gasLimit,
        address _refundAddress 
    ) internal nonReentrant {
        ...

        // append message to L1MessageQueue
        IL1MessageQueue(_messageQueue).appendCrossDomainMessage(_counterpart, _gasLimit, _xDomainCalldata);

        ...

    }

```

1. `appendCrossDomainMessage()` will call the `_validateGasLimit()` function, passing the gas limit specified by the user, together with the total `data` that must be sent to the destination. Among other checks, `_validateGasLimit()` will call the `calculateIntrinsicGasFee()` function, and a check will be performed to ensure that the gas limit passed by the user is equal or greater than the computed `intrinsicGas`:

```solidity
// File: L1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle.sol

function appendCrossDomainMessage(
        address _target,
        uint256 _gasLimit,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external override onlyMessenger {
        // validate gas limit
        _validateGasLimit(_gasLimit, _data); 
   
        // do address alias to avoid replay attack in L2.
        address _sender = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(_msgSender());
   
        _queueTransaction(_sender, _target, 0, _gasLimit, _data); 
    }

    function _validateGasLimit(uint256 _gasLimit, bytes calldata _calldata) internal view {
        require(_gasLimit <= maxGasLimit, "Gas limit must not exceed maxGasLimit");
        // check if the gas limit is above intrinsic gas
        uint256 intrinsicGas = calculateIntrinsicGasFee(_calldata);
        require(_gasLimit >= intrinsicGas, "Insufficient gas limit, must be above intrinsic gas");
    }
```

1. `calculateIntrinsicGasFee()` will finally perform the estimation of the gas limit in order to deliver the message:

```solidity
// L1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle.sol

function calculateIntrinsicGasFee(bytes calldata _calldata) public pure virtual returns (uint256) { 
        // no way this can overflow `uint256`
        unchecked {
            return INTRINSIC_GAS_TX + _calldata.length * APPROPRIATE_INTRINSIC_GAS_PER_BYTE; 
        }
    }

```

As a summary, `calculateIntrinsicGasFee()` calculates the required gas limit by multiplying the total calldata length to be sent by the cost of sending each byte in the calldata (`APPROPRIATE_INTRINSIC_GAS_PER_BYTE`, which is hardcoded to 16, corresponding to the actual cost of a byte of calldata in Ethereum). Additionally,  the intrinsic gas cost of 21,000 units of gas to send a transaction in Ethereum is also added to the computation (as `INTRINSIC_GAS_TX`). 

The main concept to be aware of in this computation is that **the calculation only takes into account the cost of paying for the calldata, plus the 21,000 intrinsic gas cost for the external gas call**. This means that the actual amount of gas that will be consumed by the call on the destination chain is **NOT** accounted for when veryfing the gas limit. As a TLDR, this computation only ensures that the cost of sending a transaction plus delivering the calldata is enough, but it does not account for the actual cost that the transaction will consume when being executed (i.e, the cost of the opcodes and the logic executed inside the transaction).

#### The actual bug and root cause

The bug reported in this issue focuses on two main points in the implementation:

- **Limit on the amount of times a failed transaction can be replayed**: Because transactions can only be replayed up to `maxReplayTimes`, and the `replayMessage()` function is permissionless, a malicious user can trigger `replayMessage()` several times for any user's failed transactions, exhausting the amount of times the transaction can be replayed. Note that the user will not be able to drop the message unless it has failed due to being dropped on the destination (which will only occur for a specific subset of messages that have triggered a ciruit overflow).
- **Conservative estimation of gas limit**: Because the gas limit computation performed in `calculateIntrinsicGasFee()` is too conservative, it is possible for the attacker to replay the messages setting a gas limit that **is guaranteed to always make the message fail on the destination chain**. This is because, as shown before, `calculateIntrinsicGasFee()` only takes into account the cost of paying for the calldata.

The attack path section details how this can be leveraged to force user's funds to be stuck forever in the contract, as well as to completely DoS of the `replayMessage()` functionality in Morph.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user has sent a cross-layer transaction from the L1→L2.
2. The user has set an insufficient gas limit value, and the transaction on the L2 has failed due to an out of gas error.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Because of this, the following scenario can take place:

1. A user wants to bridge some ETH from Ethereum to Morph. He calls the `depositETH()` function in the `L1ETHGateway` and 10 ETH are deposited into the protocol. `depositETH()` will then interact with the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` to send the L1->L2 cross-layer message. In this initial call (and due to the conservative gas estimations), the user sets a gas limit that is not enough to execute the message on the L2, so the message fails on the destination (note that this is a completely acceptable scenario, and as per the current implementation of Morph users should be able to replay their failed messages if situations like this occur).
2. A malicious user sees the failed transaction and calls `replayMessage()` up to `maxReplayTimes`. He sets the minimum possible gas limit in each replay call so that the function is guaranteed to fail on Morph (note that the gas limit is not required to be greater than the gas limit set in the original transaction, but only greater or equal to the gas cost estimated by `calculateIntrinsicGasFee()`). The transaction is guaranteed to fail on Morph due to the fact that, as mentioned in previous sections, the gas cost estimations are extremely conservative, and don’t account for the logic that will take place on the destination chain (they only account for the intrinsic gas costs + the cost of calldata).
3. As a result, the initial user can no longer replay the message because it has already been replayed up to `maxReplayTimes` by the malicious user. The replays have been guaranteed to fail due to the conservative nature of the current gas cost estimations, and the user can’t get the funds back by dropping the message because the `dropMessage()` functionality is only allowed for messages that are skipped (i.e messages that cause a circuit overflow), which is not the case as messages failing in the L2 due to a low gas limit are not skipped, and are actually considered valid transactions.

### Impact

As shown, the excessively conservative gas estimation in the gas limit computation, together with the limitation in the number of times a transaction can be replayed leads to two critical scenarios:

- The replay message functionality in the protocol can be effectively DoS'ed, as messages can always be replayed by anyone with a gas limit that is guaranteed to fail on the destination chain. This can lead to funds stuck on the L1. The amount will depend on each user’s transaction, but might vary from low amounts to huge amounts.
- User's funds that have already been transferred in a transaction that fails due to gas limit can be effectively locked forever in the contract, given that the replay functionality can be DoS'ed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

For this scenario, it is recommended to always ensure that the caller of either the `replayMessage()` or `dropMessage()` functions is the actual `_from` address specified. If it is expected for Morph to also sometimes be able to replay or drop messages on behalf of users, an additional functionality that could be added to expand the flexibility of the functions would be to add an approvals mapping, so that users can approve who can replay/drop their messages.

In addition, I highly encourage the Morph team to explore how other cross-chain protocols apply mitigations to the core issues mentioned in this report.

- Optimism fixes the conservative gas limit estimation by adding extra values in the computation of the gas limit.
    - In their [`CrossDomainMessenger`'s `sendMessage()` function](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d48b45954c381f75a13e61312da68d84e9b41418/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L176), gas limit is not only passed as the `_minGasLimit` parameter specified by the user, but an additional [baseGas](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d48b45954c381f75a13e61312da68d84e9b41418/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L183) function is called in order to [account for additional gas that might be consumed on the destination chain](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d48b45954c381f75a13e61312da68d84e9b41418/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L342-L359).

```solidity
// File: CrossDomainMessenger.sol (<https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d48b45954c381f75a13e61312da68d84e9b41418/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L342-L359>)
function baseGas(bytes calldata _message, uint32 _minGasLimit) public pure returns (uint64) {
        return
        // Constant overhead
        RELAY_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD
        // Calldata overhead
        + (uint64(_message.length) * MIN_GAS_CALLDATA_OVERHEAD)
        // Dynamic overhead (EIP-150)
        + ((_minGasLimit * MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_NUMERATOR) / MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_DENOMINATOR)
        // Gas reserved for the worst-case cost of 3/5 of the `CALL` opcode's dynamic gas
        // factors. (Conservative)
        + RELAY_CALL_OVERHEAD
        // Relay reserved gas (to ensure execution of `relayMessage` completes after the
        // subcontext finishes executing) (Conservative)

        // opcode. (Conservative)
        + RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER;
    }

```

- In Chainlink's CCIP, the gas limit specified by users when a transaction is replayed **[can't be smaller than the limit specified in the original cross-chain message](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/blob/ccip-develop/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/offRamp/EVM2EVMOffRamp.sol#L246-L250)**. This prevents the issue where messages replayed can be set the same gas limit that made the original transaction to fail:

```solidity
// File: EVM2EVMOffRamp.sol (<https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/blob/ccip-develop/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/offRamp/EVM2EVMOffRamp.sol#L246-L250>)

function manuallyExecute(
    Internal.ExecutionReport memory report,
    GasLimitOverride[] memory gasLimitOverrides
  ) external {
    // We do this here because the other _execute path is already covered OCR2BaseXXX.
    ...
      // Checks to ensure message cannot be executed with less gas than specified.
      if (newLimit != 0) {
        if (newLimit < message.gasLimit) {
          revert InvalidManualExecutionGasLimit(message.messageId, message.gasLimit, newLimit);
        }
      }

}

```

In addition, neither Optimism nor CCIP limit the amount of times a message can be replayed. This prevents the bug described in this report from taking place.
